# Discrepancy in public data publications

## Context <a name="context"></a>

The openness of data has increased in importance in recent years. Many new laws have been enacted to regulate and improve "Open Data". For example, the 2003 and 2019 Open Data Directive of the EU, the OPEN Government Data Act in the USA or the Open-Data-Gesetz 2017 in Germany. But these laws mainly associate openness with open data. This is certainly one of the main aspects, but at least as important is the coverage, i.e. the quantity and quality of the data. Because without qualitative data or without data in general, the best openness is worthless. While everyone is free to use the data, the problems cannot be solved without sufficient data.
